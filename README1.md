# Homework assignment 1

-I have added the necessary HTML accesibility features to make this website a legal and functioning website for people that may not be able to utilize normally.

-Fixed a broken link and fixed the miscolored 'SEO' in the header

-Also, I have consolidated the code, replacing 'div' when it was not needed and replaced with more relevant tags. 

-I also consolidated some CSS code because multiple sections had the same properties, so those class id's were changed to the same thing as opposed to separate classes and put into one command of CSS
